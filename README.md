This is app is supposed to be simple chat app.
It is still on progress and i think it will never be completed haha.

The app uses Firebase and MVP pattern as the architecture. I also use RxJava2 in some cases.
I dont really know if the implementation is the correct one, so if there's anything wrong with the implementation, please bear with it. I'm still rough stone in the rock. 
And also, i didnt use TDD aproach in this development, but maybe i'll add that later for the sake of learning.
