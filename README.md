# SecretTalk

This is app is supposed to be simple chat app and its purpose is for learning only.
It is still on progress and i think it will never be completed haha.

It is still rough stone in the rock.

The app uses Firebase and MVP pattern as the architecture. I also use RxJava2 in some places.
I dont really know if the implementation is the correct one, so if there's anything wrong with the implementation, please bear with it.
